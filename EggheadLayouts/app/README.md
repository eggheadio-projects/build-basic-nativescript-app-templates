# Build Basic NativeScript App Templates

The code in this repository coincides with Brad Martin's course on egghead.io [here](https://egghead.io/courses/build-basic-nativescript-app-templates).

To follow along with this course, you will need a simulator or device to run the NativeScript app on your computer (e.g. XCode). 

Setup:

Clone github repository.

`cd` into `app`.

Run  
```
tns run ios --emulator
``` 
to open the app in your simulator. (If the simulator is properly equipped for this app, it will open automatically. Otherwise, it may prompt you to set up necessary packages. Initial build may take some time.)

The simulator will open with a menu to navigate between lessons.

Use the `.xml` files in under the `pages` section of the `app` to follow along with the course.

*Note: Styling may differ from videos, especially for iOS users.
